### About
A simple, minimal, entity component-based engine/framework aimed at learning and experimenting with different data layout patterns and CPU cache padding techniques. Current features include custom sprite loading and animations, custom tile maps, AABB collision detection, keyboard controls, custom event handling, a camera system, and sprite culling.

### Building
The solution is self contained and comes with all the required dependencies. To build, open the solution and select either Debug or Release as the configuration, and x64 as the platform. Then hit run in the debugger.

### Demo Scene
Use <kbd>WSAD</kbd> or <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> to move. Use <kbd>Space</kbd> to fire a projectile every second, and hit <kbd>B</kbd> on your keyboard to toggle render debug mode. Crashing into enemies will result in player destruction.
